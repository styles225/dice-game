First practice project. Can be viewed live here at http://jarrickanderson.com/dice-game/

The object of the game is to reach 10 points before the other player. (The original version was 100 points, but ain't nobody got time for that.)

Each dice roll gets added to your current score. If you roll a 1, you lose your round score and it's the next player's turn. If you "hold" instead, then your current score gets added to your total score and it's the next player's turn.
